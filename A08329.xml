            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CONTENTS OF THE ſeuerall parts of this Treatiſe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt part (beſides a briefe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the priuate ſpirit firſt prefixed therto) it is diſputed <hi>Categoricè,</hi> and abſolutly, that the Scripture is not the Iudge of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies. And this euicted from the difficulty of the Scripture, in regard of its Subiect, ſeueral ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and phraze of the stile; as alſo from Reaſon, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Fathers, Doctrine of Traditions &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Part it is diſputed <hi>Hypotheticè,</hi> that ſuppoſing for the time, that the Scripture (as it is ſimply co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in it ſelf) were the iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies; yet it is proued, that of all the different kynds of Sectaries, that euer were, the Proteſtants can with the least reaſon inſiſt in it, as Iudge. And this is made euident by three ſeuerall wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe the Proteſtants cannot agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues, what Bookes are true Scripture, and conſequently do not agree in aſsigning, which bookes doe concurre to the making vp of this Iudge;
<pb facs="tcp:21055:3"/>
ſome allotting more bookes to it, ſome fewer; and ſo they make it of greater or leſſer extent, then (euen according to their ſeuerall opinions) it should be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe euen of thoſe Bookes, which the Proteſtants ioyntly imbrace for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture, there is not (in their iudgments) any one entire true Original, either Hebrew or Greeke now to be found, neither are there any traſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of them now extant, but ſuch as are (by the Ptoteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts aſſertions) falſe, corrupt, and impure: And ſo by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding the Scripture for Iudge, they obtrude (at least by their owne Doctrine) a falſe, corrupt, and impure Iudge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> &amp; lastly, becauſe euen of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular bookes only, or parts of Canonicall Scripture, whoſe Originalls in them yet extant are true, and whoſe tranſlations in thoſe paſſages are admitted by the Proteſtants for true and vncorrupted, the texts and teſtimonies do make againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and in behalfe of the Catholike Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if we inſiſt either in the perſpicuity of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words, or in the iudgment of the auncient Fathers interpreting the ſaid texts, or finally in the implicit &amp; tacit cenſure &amp; acknowledgment of the Proteſtants the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. And thus the Proteſtants by appealing to Scripture, do wound themſelues.</p>

And in this ſort it followeth not, that the Church is aboue Gods Word (for it is only a vigilant Depoſitary and Guardian thereof) but aboue the iudgement of particuler men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting his Word; which men do commonly make their priuate and reuealing ſpirit, to become (as it were) their <hi>Mercuryes-rod,</hi> therewith to chaſe away all conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Scripture, not ſorting to their phantaſyes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Scripture, receaue any ſtrength and force (which afore it wanted) from this ſentence and iudgment of the Church, but only our vnderſtanding is ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; confirmed thereby: which ſentence of the Church is not meerely the Word of man (which is lyable to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and vncertainty) but in ſome ſort it may be tearmed the Word of God (as being deliuered by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt) in regard of thoſe infallible promiſes made in the Scriptures to the Church, that ſhe <note n="(b)" place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2. But to proceed further in acknowledging our due reſpect to the Scriptures, we graunt moſt freely, that they are the ſpirituall conduits, whereby are deriued to vs the higheſt miſteryes of our fayth; that the bleſſed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21055:10"/>
penners of them were ſo directed by the holy Ghoſt, as that they neither did, nor could erre in any one letter; that they tranſcend in worth and dignity all humane wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as farre as an infallibility of truth ſurpaſſeth a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of errour. Laſtly that the ſenſe of them is a moſt powerfull and working phiſicke againſt the poyſonous receitps of all hereticall diſtillations, if ſo it be deliuered by the appointment of our ſpirituall Phiſitian. So vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and reuerent reſpect (we ſee) the Catholiks do beare to the ſacred Scripture, as to one chiefe meanes ordained by God for our eternall health and wellfare; yet withall they teach, that true fayth is to be found not in <hi>leaues of the wordes, but in the roole of the ſenſe;</hi> thus making the true and indubious interpretation of Gods word to be a rule to the Proteſtants imaginary rule: ſince it is to ouerule &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule the priuate ſpirit of euery particuler Sectary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But now in the next place, to enter more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly into the ſtate of this point, touching the Scriptures ſuppoſed Iudge of fayth, we are to conceaue, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Sectaryes do generally maintaine, that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God is the ſole and infallible Iudge, as alſo the only rule and ſquare of the articles of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, thereby reiecting not only any other Iudge, but alſo all other points touching fayth, which haue not their expreſſe proofe or neceſſary inference in the ſayd holy Scriptures; The Catholikes on the other ſide (running one and the ſame line of fayth with all antiquity) teach as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Firſt that the holy Scripture is not the Iudge of all Controuerſyes of fayth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly they teach, that it is <hi>norma infallibilis,</hi> an infallible rule or ſquare of fayth, that is, that nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scripture is to be admitted; but they ſay not, that it is the only rule of ſquare, and therefore they affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that beſids the Scripture there are Apoſtolical traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and other definitions of the Church. Thus we grant, that the written word is, <hi>regula partialis,</hi> but not <hi>regula totalis,</hi> of fayth and Religion; and therefore we admitte ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21055:11"/>
thinges <hi>praeter Scripturam,</hi> but nothing <hi>contra Scripturam;</hi> that is, we approue ſome thinges not expreſly ſound in the Scripture, but not any thing contrary or repugnant to the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thirdly, they hould, that graunting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the rule or ſquare of moſt articles of religion, yet it followeth not, that it is the Iudge of the ſayd arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſince <hi>Regula,</hi> and <hi>Iudex</hi> are in nature things different; for euen in ciuill matters the law is the rule and ſqare, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, ſuites and contentions are determined; and yet the law is not the Iuge of them, but the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelfe expounding the law, though ſometymes the Law is called improperly and Metaphorically the Iudge.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Fourthly, and laſtly, they deny not, but that the Scripture may in a reſtained ſenſe be tearmed the Iudge of all Controuerſies in faith; becauſe it <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. <hi>Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. vlt.

And thus on the one ſyde, the Scripture warranting the Churches authority, and on the other, the Church ſetting downe and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the true ſenſe of the Scripture; it may hereupon be iuſtly ſayd, that both theſe (I meane the Church and the Scripture) do interchangeably receaue their proofe, out of the proofe they giue. Therfore all impertinencyes layd aſide, the touch of the queſtion heere between our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaryes and vs reſteth in this: <hi>Whether all thinges, which</hi>

                     <hi>neceſſarily belong to religion, are ſo fully and abundantly deliuered in the Scripture, as that they are either expreſly contained therein, or els without the Churches authority interpoſed, they may particuler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be neceſſarily deduced from the Scripture; and ſo in regard heerof, whether the Scripture is to become the only Iudge of ſuch arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So faire different in opinion are our Sectaryes from the iudgment of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> touching the interpoſition of the Churches authority in the expoſition of Scripture, who thus writeth <note n="(d)" place="margin">In ſuo Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitorio.</note> heerof: <hi>Multum neceſſe eſt &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now that the Scripture is not the Iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſyes in the ſenſe aboue ſet downe, ſhalbe proued two wayes.

                  <p n="12">12. The ſecond ſenſe or conſtruction of the Fathers wordes touching the perſpicuity of the written word, is, that the Scripture is cleare and euident, in that it doth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21055:26"/>
illuminate and enlighten the mynd of the reader, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Scripture (a verity which we acknowledge, as elſewhere is ſhewed) as it is explained by the ſpirit of God, which ſpirit ſpeaketh in the voyce of his Church. And in this ſenſe (to omit the like ſentences of diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers) <hi>Epiphanius</hi> 
                     <note n="(x)" place="margin">

                  <p n="13">13. To the former two ſenſes, wherein the Fathers do call the Scripture perſpicuous, cleare, and facill, I wil add a third reaſon, which moued them ſometymes ſo to call them. This is taken from a certaine abuſe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of people in thoſe tymes, who framing to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a greater difficulty in the Scripture then there is, altogether forbare the reading of it, and in place thereof gaue themſelues (more then was conuenient) to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding of prophane ſpectacles and ſightes. Now, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue the people of this abuſe and negligence, and the ſooner to inuite them to the reading and hearing of Gods word, the Fathers thought good, in an Oratory and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying manner to ſuggeſt to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an eaſines of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

And thus farre of the Fathers ſuppoſed defence and maintaining of our Sectaries Doctrine in this queſtion of the Scriptures ſole Iudge: where we ſee, that though the places vrged by our aduerſaries out of their wrytings, at the firſt ſight, ſeeme to carry a faire and ſpecious gloſſe or graine, yet being after fully weighed and conſidered, they giue no ſatisfaction (for proofe of what they were alleadged) to a perfect and true iudgment, being like vnto thoſe flowers, which beſt pleaſing the eye, do commonly leaſt pleaſe the ſmell.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Now, our Aduerſaries Doctrine herein is no more iuſtiſiable, if they will here vnderſtand the whole body of all the Canonicall books of Scripture, ioyntly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered together, to be this Iudge (which aſſertion they for the moſt part maintaine;) And the reaſon therof is this; In that diuers Canonicall and vndoubted parcels (euen by the Proteſtants acknowledgment) of both the old and the new teſtament, haue bene loſt for the ſpace of 1500. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and neuer yet found againe: And therfore it ineuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly followeth, that if all the ſacred books of Scripture ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together ſhould be this iudge, and that diuers of them for ſo many Centuries and ages haue bene, and ſtill are loſt; that then during ſo long a tyme, we neuer enioyed a ſufficient and competent Iudge, and ſuch a one, as was proportionable to that fayth left to vs by the Prophets, Apoſtles and Euangeliſts; but in lieu therof we haue had a maimed, imperfect, and defectiue Iudge.

                  <p n="5">5. Another reaſon for the incompetency of the Scripture as Iudge, may be taken from the nature of a iudge (as is elſe where touched) conſtituted in euery well gouerned Common wealth. For it cleare, that euery Iudge firſt ought to be able of his owne authority to take notice of the Contentions and Controuerſies ryſing in the ſtate. Secondly, he muſt haue power by interpreting the law to giue his cenſure againſt the party offending. Laſtly, he is to compell and force the delinquents to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnder the paine of feuere puniſhments. None of which points can be effected, except there be (beſides the wrytten law) a viſible iudge. Seing then (by applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21055:29"/>
of what is here ſayd to our preſent purpoſe) that the Scripture cannot of it ſelfe take notice of Controuerſies ryſing in matters of religion, nor euidently declare to the Litigants the true meaning of ſuch paſſages, of it ſelf war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting or condemning the points in queſtion; nor final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can conſtraine the aduerſe party to relinquiſh his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours impugned by the wrytten Word, (as we find by the dayly experience of Heretikes flying to the Scripture as Iudge;) Therfore it is moſt perſpicuous, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be erected as a competent Iudge in the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of articles of fayth among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Neyther is it any ſatisfiable anſwere to reply, that God himſelfe ſeeth all Contentions in doubts of fayth, and in ſome ſort by meanes of the Scripture pronounceth his ſentence in condemnation of the hereſies impugned. This (I ſay) is not ſufficient, and the reaſon hereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God doth not ſo euidently deliuer his ſentence by the mediation of the Scripture, as the party conuinced therby will acknowledge it for his ſentence; And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if the queſtion ſhould be, whether the Scripture be the word of God or not, God could not clearly giue his iudgment only by the helpe of Scripture. Therfore it followeth, that we muſt haue a viſible iudge, and ſuch as his finall decrees being once manifeſted, the party main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his errours, will acknowledge them (as they proceed from the Iudge, whether iuſtly or iniuſtly) to be clearly and euidently condemned by the ſayd iudge, which we ſee falleth not out in obtruding the Scripture; for it is obſerued, that the Anabaptiſt or any other ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged heretike, wil neuer confeſſe his hereſies to be impugned by the Scripture, or himſelf conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned therby.</p>

Firſt, how they can proue out of Scripture the particuler Ghoſpell of <hi>S. Marke,</hi> or of any Euangeliſt, to be the ſame, without all corruption, which the ſayd <hi>Marke,</hi> or the other did wryte? conſidering that it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, euen by our aduerſaries, that diuers parcels of the Scriptures haue bene fouly corrupted and mangled by the Additions, Tranſlations, and other ſuch like depraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the auncient heretikes. Secondly, if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, that any one Ghoſpell, or other part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the very ſame vntoucht and vndefiled, as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour therof did firſt wryte it; yet if we ſhould demand of them, how the Scripture can aſſure and determine this poynt, to wit, that ſuch a Ghoſpell (as for example that of <hi>S. Marke)</hi> is true and Canonicall Scripture, and yet that the obtruded Ghoſpell of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> is a falſe &amp; prophane wryting, ſince both theſe Ghoſpells haue indifferently in the beginning their ſeuerall prefixed titles, the one but of an Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt, &amp; yet accepted, the other euen of an Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, but reiected; what could they ſay? Thirdly if it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were the particular books, which maks vp the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Scripture, yet if any prophan <hi>Atheist</hi> ſhould arriue to that height of impiety, as to deny flatly, that ther were any ſuch diuine wrytinges at all, as to be counted Gods ſacred word or Scripture; how could our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

conuince him herein by the Scripture it ſelfe? It were idle for them to reply, that the Scripture telleth him, that the bookes of the Prophets and the Apoſtles are diuine wrytinges, ſince the <hi>Atheist</hi> would not belieue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo ſaying, vntill it were proued to him (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be out of the Scripture) that this Scripture (affirming ſo much) is Scripture, that is, a diuine, ſupernaturall and ſacred wryting; no more then at this preſent, we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians belieue that the Iewes <hi>Thalmud</hi> is diuine Scripture, though it be countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced with the title of Gods vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Firſt, becauſe they do not agree among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues which ſeuerall books ordinarily contained within the printed volume of the Bible, are Scripture, and which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21055:39"/>
are not. Secondly, in that they do not acknowledge any original copy now extant to be true and incorrupted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuch bookes, as they all ioyntly receaue for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as alſo in that they condemne all Tranſlations of confeſſed Scripture (as falſe and erroneous) eyther into Greeke, Latin, or Engliſh. Thirdly, becauſe the confeſſed and incorrupted Scripture more clearly maketh for the Catholikes, then for our Aduerſaries, if we inſiſt eyther in the perſpicuity of the letter, or in the expoſitions of the Fathers, or in the implicite iudgments of our Aduerſaries themſelues. Which three poynts, being iuſtifyed and made good (the proofe wherof ſhall be the ſubiect of this Part) it cannot be conceaued, how they ſhould defend (with any aduantage to themſelues) the Scripture to be this Iudge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And intending to begin with their diſſentions in acknowledging or reiecting certaine bookes of Scripture; we are firſt particularly and attentiuely to obſerue, that wheras all Controuerſies of fayth are to be determined (as our Aduerſaries hould) by the Canonicall Scripture, which is the only written word of God: And ſeing they are at endles ſtryfe one with another, which is this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; one acknowledging ſuch and ſuch bookes to be this ſacred word, which another diſcanoneth as apocryphall and prophane: Therfore they in no ſort can pretend the Scripture to be the iudge of Controuerſies, as not being yet reſolued amongſt themſelues, which thoſe bookes be that are to be counted within the body and Canon of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; and conſequently not agreed with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which is this iudge. For except this laſt poynt be firſt acknowledged on al ſides, it followeth, that if a Lutheran againſt a Caluiniſt, or one Caluiniſt againſt another, do vrge a place or text of ſuch a booke, which the one ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgeth to be Scripture, the other condemning it; the vrging of ſuch a place can be of no force for the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the queſtion controuerted; ſince it wilbe replyed, that the Canonicall and true Scripture alone is to defyne all doubts of fayth; but that booke, out of which ſuch
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21055:39"/>
places and texts are alledged, is no part of Gods wrytten word, and therfore is not of authority for proofe of any poynt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now that our Aduerſaries cannot agree hitherto what bookes are true Scripture, and what are not, it will appeare moſt euidently euen out of their owne wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges. And firſt to begin with their diſagrements in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion touching the bookes of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; in which poynt I will ſpeake nothing of certaine parts of <hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Eſter,</hi> neyther of the bookes of <hi>Toby, Iudith,</hi> of the booke of <hi>Wiſedome, Eccleſiasticus,</hi> and the <hi>Machabees;</hi> ſince our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries with a full and ioynt conſent haue thruſt al theſe out of the Canon of the Bible (though if they be to deale with Catholikes, and will needes haue the Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to iudge of all queſtions, they ought to acknowledge al thoſe bookes to be parcell of Scripture, which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes do take for Scripture:) But I will reſtraine my ſelfe only to ſuch, the which ſome of them do reuerence as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall, and others reiect as Apocryphall; from whence it followeth (as I ſayd before) that, they diſagreeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues, what bookes are parts of the holy Scripture, and conſequently of their ſuppoſed iudge, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any ſhew of reaſon, maintaine, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to determine (at leaſt among them) al doubts of Religion whatſoeuer.</p>

Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it moſt neceſſarily followeth, that though it might be dreamed for the tyme (as I ſayd aboue) that the Scripture might be iudge of Controuerſies among them which acknowledge with one conſent ſuch and ſuch bookes only to be Scripture (ſince all they agree, what bookes thoſe be, which are to be this iudge:) Yet our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries wherwith we now deale, cannot poſſibly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame for iudge; for they diſagreing with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the bookes which are Scripture, muſt needs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree, which is this iudge, and how farre it reacheth; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

one of them either extending it beyond it limites, or ſtraitning it within to narrow a compaſſe. Therfore it is no more poſſible, that the Scripture ſhould decyde all Controuerſies with the Proteſtants (ſo long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their contrary ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces about the authority of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers bookes therof) then it can be conceaued, how a ſuite depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding betwene two, is to be decyded by a certaine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited company of men (as there is a limited number of the Canonicall bookes of Scripture) or els not to be tryed at all, and yet the one of theſe Litigants ſhould diſclaime from diuers of the ſayd deputed Iudges, as altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent and inſufficient, and the other in like ſort fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſundry of the other iudges. Can it be conceaued (I ſay) how this matter ſhould be ended, both the parties ſtill perſeuering without change in their ſeuerall auerſions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſeuerall perſons of the intended Iudges; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the iudgment of the matter were not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, but with this condition, that both the Litigant parties ſhould freely and voluntarily agree aforehand in the number and in the particular perſons of thoſe iudges, by whome they would haue their queſtion and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy determined? And thus it iuſt fareth with our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as long as they diſagree what bookes are the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scripture, and yet will they haue this Scripture alone to determine and reſolue all poynts of fayth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. To this argument drawne from their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of acknowledging what bookes are the word of God; Our Aduerſaries can only reply, that though there be ſome particular bookes (as theſe aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) of which they are not abſolutely reſolued, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are to be accounted as parcells of Gods word or no: yet ſince they all agree in acknowledging the reſt of the bookes to be Canonicall; all thoſe other bookes ſo ioyntly acknowledged by them for Scripture ought to be taken for this iudge of Controuerſies. Which anſwere of theirs is moſt weake and relieues them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, and this for ſeuerall reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:21055:42"/>
15. And firſt, ſeing there are many bookes both of the old Teſtament and of the new (not ſpeaking of thoſe bookes in the old, which are ioyntly condemned by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, and acknowledged by Catholikes) which are impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome of our Aduerſaries and defended by others: And that by all probability, yea morall certainty, ſome one or other of thoſe bookes ſo impugned by ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is (though not ſo acknowledged) Gods ſacred word; which being ſo, it muſt needes then follow, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants teaching the Scripture to be the iudge and ſquare of all doubts and Controuerſies, and attributing this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue not to any one booke a part, (ſince any one booke or other is not able to decyde all doubts, which may ariſe, in that it intreateth not of all poynts which may come in queſtion) but to the whole body and Canon of the Scripture:) It muſt follow (I ſay) that this ſuppoſed iudge of theirs is maimed and imperfect, as wanting ſome one booke or other, which (being reiected by ſome of our Auerſaries) ſhould concurre to the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and full perfection or accompliſhment of it ſelfe. And therfore I conclude, that if any ſuch one booke of ſacred Scripture be exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the number of thoſe, which ſhould make vp this Iudge (as in all likelyhood ſome one or other is, ſince there are greater proofes for the authority of them all, then for condemnation of any one) it demonſtratiuely may be inferred, that our Aduerſaries cannot pretend (as long as they thus contend, which bookes be Scripture) the Scripture to be this their iudge; it being taught by our Aduerſaries, that <hi>fides</hi> is not <hi>obiectum adaequatum,</hi> to any one booke or parcell of Scripture, but to the whole Canon it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Secondly, if only ſuch bookes, which are ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receaued by all our Aduerſaries, are to make vp this Iudge, and no others; then would it follow, that there are diuers poynts of Fayth, which by their owne ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgment are neceſſary to be beleeued, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proued at all, or at leaſt clearly inough, out of ſuch parcells of Scripture, as they all acknowledge to be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21055:42"/>
Scripture, though moſt euidently proued out of thoſe parts, which are reiected by ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple if the three firſt Goſpels are to be reiected (as <hi>Luther</hi> teacheth) we ſhall fynd, that there are diuers poynts touching our Sauiours <hi>Incarnation</hi> (and particularly that he was borne of a Virgin) as alſo his life, &amp; conuerſation heereupon earth, which are to be beleeued, and are found in ſome of theſe three Goſpells; and yet the Ghoſpell of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> (only which is acknowledged by <hi>Luther)</hi> maketh no mention of them, neyther are they at al touched in any other ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledged booke of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Thirdly, though it were ſuppoſed, that only thoſe bookes of Scripture, which all our Aduerſaries doe ioyntly acknowledge for Canonicall were to decyde and iudge all poynts of Fayth, yet could not thoſe books per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſo much, except it were firſt agreed among them, that there were ſome certaine originall copies or ſome tranſlations now extant of them, which our Aduerſaries would acknowledge for true and vncorrupted (ſince o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not the true word of God, but the word of God as it is corrupted, ſhould become the iudge of our Fayth.) But there are no Originals nor Tranſlations of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure (ſpeaking euen of thoſe bookes which themſelues do ioyntly acknowledge) that are now extant, which they do not charge with ſundry corruptions and falſifications, as it ſhall appeare moſt euidently in theſe Chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: So manifeſt it is, that euen thoſe bookes only, as are acknowledged by all our Aduerſaries, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the iudge of Controuerſies.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But before we come to the Tranſlations, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that as we haue ſhewed aboue, that our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries do reiect many bookes of vndoubted and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture; and conſequently, that they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Scripture as iudge: So we will in this place ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the carriage and comportment of the Proteſtants to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Euangeliſts and the Apoſtles; whom diuers of our Sectaries haue not bene affraid to charge with foule errours in manner and practiſe or exerciſe of their faith.

                     <note n="(i)" place="margin">vbi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> (I ſay) fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing this ineuitable illation, pronounceth plainly that the Greeke text is corrupted (meaning therby all Greeke Editions, that euer were in his tyme) and the Greeke word forcing this conſtruction, crept out of the margent into the text, ſo making theſe words meere ſurreptitious. And this now may ſuffice to ſhew, that the Greeke Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall is neyther ſo abſolutely authenticall in it ſelfe, nor at leaſt ſo acknowledged by our Aduerſaries, as that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tranſlations, or doubts ryſing in points of fayth, may infallibly be tryed therby.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now to reflect ſomewhat vpon our argument, drawne from the acknowledged corruptions of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginalls of both the Teſtaments: How can our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with any ſhew of common vnderſtanding, pretend the Scriptures to be the only iudge with them, when by their owne confeſſions, they haue no true and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Originall of ſuch bookes only as themſelues ioyntly acknowledge for Scripture? What can our Aduerſaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply hereto? Will they anſwere that ſuch corruptions, wherwith the Originalls are ſtained do happen only in ſuch places, as are not controuerſiall, (and therfore the leſſe materiall) but that al thoſe paſſages &amp; texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which do preciſely touch any poynt of Chryſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are moſt free from all ſuch eſcapes? This anſwere faileth ſeuerall wayes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Firſt, becauſe we are bound by the Proteſtantes owne principles to beleeue nothing, with is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Scriptures: But we read not in any place or text of them, that God will euer preſerue his wrytten word, free from all corruptions in eſſentiall poynts of Chriſtian fayth, and yet ſuffer it to be generally depraued in matters of leſſer moment; Neyther can it be replyed, that God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſweet prouidence and care ouer his Church requireth, that the Scripture be free from all ſuch mayne corruptions;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21055:46"/>
This (I ſay) cannot ſatisfy vs Catholikes, who do teach, that Gods pouidence and care towards his Church doth not chiefly conſiſt in preſeruing his wrytten word, ſince fayth (for which end the Scripture was firſt wrytten) may be preſerued in the Church only by externall preaching and force of tradition: and anſwerably hereunto we read, that the church of God in the time of Nature for the ſpace of 2000. yeares enioyed no Scripture or writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word at al: in like ſort <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (l. 3. c. 4.) wryteth that there were ſome Chriſtian countries, which belieued and liued well, only by helpe of Traditions, without any wrytten word.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Secondly it is falſe, that the ſayd corruptions doe chance only in ſuch places of indifferency, as concerne not doubts of fayth; ſince the contrary is manifeſt (to omit diuers others which might be alledged) by the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer produced examples out of <hi>S. Matthew</hi> 
                     <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                        <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> and <hi>S. Luke</hi> 
                     <note n="(l)" place="margin">
                        <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</note> where we ſee, that the corruptions wherwith our Aduerſaries do charge theſe two texts, do fall iuſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the touch and point of two chiefeſt Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies of this time, to wit <hi>the Supremacy of Peter,</hi> and <hi>the Reall Preſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Thirdly if by our Aduerſaries acknowledgment all the Originalls now extant are corrupted in places not pertaining to matters of fayth, how can we be infallibly aſſured, that they are not in like ſort corrupted in texts of Controuerſies of this tyme, or of ſuch doubts, as hereafter may ryſe? Since a certainty of an errour in one place doth imply a poſſibility of errour in any other place? And yet this infallibility we ought to haue for otherwiſe we build our fayth vpon ſuch paſſages of Scripture, which we doe but thinke only to be the true and vncorrupted word of God, and conſequently it is not fayth, that is builded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon a bare morall perſuaſion of the Scriptures inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; And if this be not ſo, let our Aduerſaries ſhew ſome priuiledge &amp; warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which the Scritpture hath to be freed from the corruptions of one kind more then of another: If they ſay, that the Analogy of fayth expreſſed therin doth demonſtrate, that it is not corrupted in any ſuch funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall places; this is ridiculous: for ſeing that fayth (by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21055:47"/>
our Aduerſaries grounds) riſeth only out of the Scripture, and in that reſpect is <hi>quidda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſterius &amp; tempore &amp; naturâ,</hi> (as the Philoſophers ſay) that is, <hi>later both in tyme and nature</hi> then the Scriptures, as afore is ſhewed; therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the Analogy of fayth cannot be the ſquare or rule to meaſure the integrity &amp; incorruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therby, but it ſelfe is meaſured by the Scriptures, euen by their owne principles.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And thus much to diſcouer the weakenes of their firſt anſwere made to our Argument drawne from theyr acknowledged corruptions of the Originalls of both the Teſtaments. Or will they frame a ſecond anſwere to the ſayd argument ſaying, that though the Originalls be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, yet there are certaine tranſlations (allowed by them) which are moſt pure and agreable to the firſt Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginalls, before they were corrupted, &amp; by theſe al doubts and Controuerſies of fayth and religion are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined? This ſhift is more feeble then the former: firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was impoſſible, how the corrupted Originalls ſhould be corrected in their tranſlations, there not being in the Proteſtants iudgments in the vniuerſall world any one true copy, by the which their tranſlations might be amended, ſince all tranſlations now remaining were lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g after any true Originall was to be found, the vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, and the 70. only excepted. Secondly this anſwere ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyeth not, in that there is no one tranſlation made in Greeke, Latin, or our vulgar tongue, but our Aduerſaries do tax it with errours and corruptions; Which poynt ſhall moſt euidently and particularly be made manifeſt in the Chapters following.</p>
                  <p n="12">12.

both, doth mightily preiudice the Proteſtants, but the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes nothing at all. Not vs, in that we acknowledge the vulgar Latin tranſlation (which is altogether reiected by our aduerſaries) to be moſt ſincere and agreable to the true Originalls afore their corruption; And hereby we maintaine, that we haue, and enioy the true Scriptures. But the Proteſtants are diſaduantaged by their former aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, becauſe they refuſe not only all Originalls (now to be had) as impure and contaminated, but alſo all tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, and conſequently hauinge in their iudgments no true Scripture at all, they cannot proſtitute the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their Iudge of Controuerſies.</p>

                  <p n="2">2.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, but one or two ſhalbe ſufficient at this tyme: as for example in the firſt Chapter of the Acts, our Engliſh tranſlations ſpeaking of the election of <hi>Matthias</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle read thus: <hi>He was by a common conſent counted with the</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. In like ſort in their Bible printed anno 1577. in the ninth of the Actes, we read thus: <hi>Paul confounded the Iewes, prouing by conferring one Scripture with another, that this is very Christ,</hi> to which text our Aduerſaries did adde this ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p n="5">5. The ſecond poynt, which manifeſteth the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our Engliſh Bibles, is taken from the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together of ſeuerall textes of Scripture tranſlated in them, in which ſeuerall textes one and the ſame Greeke word (for here I ſpeake chiefly of the new Teſtament) is diuerſly tranſlated. My meaning here is this, that in textes concerning poynts of fayth betweene vs and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, the Greeke word is tranſlated by them in a forced or ſecondary ſenſe, preiudicing our Catholike fayth; the which ſame word being found in other textes, which touch not any Controuerſiall poynt, they are content to tranſlate in it true, immediate, and ordinary ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince they ſee, that in ſuch places they cannot diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage vs at all by any falſe tranſlation.</p>

which is very notorious, for wheras it ſignifieth <hi>to be made worthy indeed,</hi> they tranſlate it only, <hi>to be counted worthy,</hi> in ſuch texts wherin is included the worth &amp; merit of good workes, meaning therby, that we are not made worthy indeed, but only ſo reputed by God. Thus for example they tranſlate in the Ghoſpell of <hi>S.

                  <p n="9">9. A third Conſideration of diſplaying the falſe tranſlations of our Engliſh Bibles may be taken from the multiplicity of their tranſlations made heretofore in ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall yeares, and yet one of them croſſing another in many controuerſiall poynts of fayth betweene the Proteſtantes and vs. Now from this contrariety in tranſlation (and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21055:53"/>
in pointes of Controuerſies) is neceſſarily euicted a falſhood of their tranſlations: for ſuppoſing one tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for true, it vnauoydably followeth, that all other tranſlations, which are made abſolutely contrary to that one muſt needes be falſe and erroneous. This contrariety they vſe in infinite textes of Scripture, but I will inſtance it for great breuity only in two. Well then, their Bibles printed anno 1562. do thus read in 2. Cor. c. 6. <hi>How a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth the temple of God with Images?</hi> Againe in 1. <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 10. <hi>Be not worshippers of Images, as ſome of them are.</hi> In like ſort 1. <hi>Iohn c.</hi> 5. the ſame Bible thus readeth: <hi>Babes keepe your ſelues from Images:</hi> Al which tranſlations being ſuppoſed as true, prohibit and forbid all religious vſe and reuerence to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages whatſoeuer. But now in all their later tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s made ſince that tyme, in the former three places and texts inſteed of the word, Images, they tranſlate and read. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols: reſtraining the former prohibition to thoſe Images only, which are made Idols, and worſhipped inſteed of God. In like ſort touching Chriſtes deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding into hel, the Bibles printed anno 1562. &amp; 1577. do read thus: <hi>Thou shalt not leaue my ſoule in hell:</hi> which tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s proue Chriſts deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into hell contrary to the Doctrine of the preſent Church of England. But the later tranſlation, to wit made in the yeare 1579. 1595. and 1600. doe read, <hi>Thou shalt not leaue my ſoule in the graue;</hi> vnderſtanding the former text of the graue only, and not of hell.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Now here I ſay that, in regard of this multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and variety of Engliſh tranſlations (one mainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning &amp; croſſing another) we may moſt ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſome of theſe translations muſt needes be falſe: and which of them is true, an ignorant iudgment (ſince it hath no more reaſon to approue one then another) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well cenſure. And thus farre touching the three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kindes of diſcouering the Engliſh translations as falſe and corrupted, the Conſideration wherof doth affoard an vnanſwerable argument, that our Engliſh tranſlations in regard of their impurity, cannot, nor ought not to be pretended as iudge for the finall determining of doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall poynts in fayth and religion.</p>

11. There reſteth a ſecond way (as I ſaid) for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manifeſtation of the falſhood and corruption vſed in the tranſlation of our Engliſh Bibles, and this is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the frequent Confeſſions of the Proteſtants themſelues in this point, whoſe acknowledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts herin are ſo ful, as they take away all meanes of euading.

And thus farre now for ſome taſt of our new tranſlatours ſeuerall ſleights and colluſions in theſe few textes, the which ſleights (though for breuity omitted) might be inſtanced in many other paſſages of Scripture concerning the Controuerſies of this tyme, from al which we may iuſtly inferre, firſt, that ſeing this their laſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation (ſo much prized and applauded) is found moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and deceitfull, and indeed for the moſt part (as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And ſo by theſe deuiſes and colluſions we ſee the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture is concealed from the Proteſtant by the Proteſtant, like as the Sunne is hid from the earth, by the earth.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. But to proceed a litle further touching this laſt tranſlation: firſt how can our tranſlations therof aſſure any man of the truth of their tranſlation, ſince they ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge no Originall, or any tranſlation of the Bible (out of which they did make their tranſlation) for pure &amp; vncorrupt? Secondly, admit for the tyme, that this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation is perfect according to the true Originalls; yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it differeth in diuers controuerſiall textes and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from all former Engliſh tranſlations, it therfore from

hence followeth, that till now we here in England ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer enioyed the true and vncorrupted Scripture in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and conſequently that till theſe dayes the Scripture in Engliſh could not be iuſtly vrged to determine and iudge Controuerſies in fayth: But a true and perfect iudge is ready, not at one tyme only, but at all tymes &amp; ſeaſons to performe the function of true Iudicature.</p>

This now (among many other like paſſages of Scripture, obiected by our Aduerſaries) may ſerue to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the Fathers iudgments, in the explicating of al ſuch texts; and how far diſtant (at leaſt in thoſe learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours cenſures) they are from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicting any one point of our Catholike Fayth; &amp; conſequently how preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it were to the Proteſtants in the Fathers iudgments, to make the holy Scripture, the ſole and laſt reſort and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of Controuerſies. And here we are to aduertiſe the Reader, that he is not to expect, that the Fathers ſhould preuent in their bookes &amp; Commentaries, by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, the obiections, and arguments drawne from all ſuch places of Scripture, as are vrged by our Aduerſaries; both becauſe they could not foreſee the Hereſies of our tymes; as alſo if they had, yet could they not be induced to belieue, that any one of learning, profeſſing Chriſtian

                  <p n="30">30. Neither is the Reader to looke, that our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Expoſitions of euery text, which our Aduerſaries doe vrge againſt vs, ſhould be warranted with the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of many Fathers, (though moſt of them haue bene ſo fortified) in that, ſome ſuch paſſages of Scripture there are, of which few Fathers did vndertake to make any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Comment or expoſition at all. Only it ſuffiſeth, that we can haue our expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of euery ſuch ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtrengthned with the authorities of ſome few of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that the Proteſtants are not able to alledge ſo much as one Father interpreting in the Proteſtants conſtruction againſt our Catholike Doctrine, any one of the former al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged places of Scripture, or any one other text which our Aduerſaries alledge though heere it be not ſet downe. And now hauing thus diſlodged our Aduerſaries of their beſt couerts and places of Retyre, for patronage of their ſtrange and exorbitant Poſitions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; as alſo, hauing in the precedent Chapter forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſtrengthned with the Fathers explications the ſenſe and meaning of ſuch texs, as we produce againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will herein proceed no further, referring one point to their owne conſiderations and iudgments; to wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelues receaue greater hurt and domage, by the Fathers erecting their impregnable Forts of Gods word, from whence they make their iſſues &amp; ſallyes out in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite and profligation of theſe mens Hereſies; then by the ſayd Fathers raiſing and battering downe, the weake houlds and fortreſſes of ſuch miſapplyed texts of holy Scripture, wherin our Sectaries are wont to place theyr greateſt ſtrength and confidence; ſince by the firſt, theyr Hereſies receaue moſt deadly and incurable wounds; by the ſecond, the Catholike Faith is ſecured &amp; freed from al dangerous aſſaults and encounters.</p>

But this courſe I will purpoſely forbeare, partly to auoyde the diſtaſtfull iteration of the former texts ſo often already repeated, but chiefly in regard of the tedious prolixity, which would neceſſarily attend the deliuering (in their owne wordes) of our Aduerſaries expoſitions of all ſuch places; and in ſupply therof, I will take a more briefe (and yet no leſſe conuincing) method.

ſuch Catholike articles, no paſſages of Scripture can be alledged more forcibly and preſſingly by our Aduerſaries own cenſure, then the texts alledged in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it therfore may be concluded, that thoſe very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> texts (euen by the acknowledgment of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants) do receaue that ſenſe and conſtruction, which the Fathers, and we Catholikes haue deliuered of them for proofe and warranting of our fayth. Agayne, wheras our Aduerſaries (which maintaine any ſuch Catholike Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) will (no doubt) confidently auouch, that they teach nothing which may be contradicted by the Scripture; It in like ſort followeth, that all ſuch texts of Scripture me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
